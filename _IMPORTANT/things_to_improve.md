# Things to improve

If I had even more time, I would have:

### UI

- Add export to Excel functionality
- When sending a request to the server it shows a loader and hides it when the request is done, If the request didn't take long time it will show the loader popup and hides it so fast

### Normal Table

- Add a pagination feature
